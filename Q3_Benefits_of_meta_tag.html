Q3. What are the benefits of using meta tags.
-->

<!--Ans:
Improved Search Engine Visibility: Meta tags, such as meta descriptions and meta keywords, can provide search engines with information about 
the content of your web page, which can help improve its visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).

Accessibility: Meta tags can also provide accessibility benefits by allowing you to specify important information, such as the character set and 
language of your document, which can help ensure that your content is properly interpreted by browsers and assistive technologies.
